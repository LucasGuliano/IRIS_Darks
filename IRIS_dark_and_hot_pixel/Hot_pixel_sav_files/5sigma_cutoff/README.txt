GitHub won't (easily) host the eight 5gb .sav files here. 

If you download the pipeline without them, you will just need to remake these files from scratch the first time you run it. Code is already setup to do that if the files aren't there, it will just take way longer than starting with the current sav files. 

They are named like:
NEW_port1_FUV_hot_pixel_counts.sav
NEW_port1_NUV_hot_pixel_counts.sav
NEW_port2_FUV_hot_pixel_counts.sav...
